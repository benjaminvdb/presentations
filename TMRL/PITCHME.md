# Developing a smarter Electronic Health Record

---

## Introduction

* Insurers define the conditions that determine treatments rates for physiotherapy practices.
* Quality of a patient's electronic health record is important.
* Increasing pressure on therapists for providing data.

---

## Motivation

1. Therapists spend 26% of their time doing administrative work.
2. The systems do not provide feedback using this data in any meaningful way.
3. This clearly induces more stress and results in less billable hours and an increase of the healthcare costs.
